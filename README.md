## Learning objectives

What do you want to get better at?

Servers, rendering with templates, using databases and APIs. I want to do something that incorporates aspects of all these things. If appropriate, I would also like to use a new framework and/or see how I can include npm modules I haven't used.

## Description

A description of your project.

Idea 1:

A tinder-esk app except intended for users looking for a new furry SPCA friend. Users would set up a profile and be shown a series of adorable potential pets based on a few filters (eg; dog, black lab, age<1 yr). The user could swipe left or right depending on what they thought of the pet's "profile" (which would include a few photos, their name, a quick description or story about them and their personality, maybe an indication of their cost, their age and where they are located) and the ones they liked would be saved to a shortlist on the user's profile. The app could then keep the user informed of how their potential pet is tracking, how many others have shortlisted them, and if they're still available for adoption.
Outside of this there could also be tips on how to take proper care of your animal, what to feed them, helping them adjust to their new home etc.

## Milestones

### MVP 1
  * A site that shows the user a database of animals and allows them to save the ones they like.

### Stretch Goals
  * Users have a profile that stores their data between sessions allowing them to pick up where they left off.
  * The animal database is pulled from SPCA website, either through an API, a .csv file or a web scraper.
  * The user is able to search through animals using different filters eg: dogs, cats, small animals etc; and display them in a variety of ways eg: alphebetical, colour etc.
  * The user is able to keep track on the animals they have saved and see key details like vaccination/microchip status, profile views, how long they've been there etc.
